// const MAN_DESCRIPTION: &str = r#"
// \fB{bin_name}\fR is an Interception Tools filter designed to eliminate keyboard chatter (also known as switch bounce).
// It reads Linux \fBinput_event\fR(5) structs from standard input, filters out rapid duplicate key events below a configurable time threshold, and writes the filtered events to standard output.
// Statistics are printed to standard error on exit or periodically.
//
// Keyboard chatter occurs when a single physical key press or release generates multiple electrical signals due to the mechanical contacts bouncing. This can result in unintended duplicate characters or actions. \fB{bin_name}\fR addresses this by ignoring subsequent identical key events (same key code and same state \- press or release) that occur within the specified \fB\-\-debounce\-time\fR.
// .PP
// The filter maintains state independently for each key code (0-1023) and for each state (press=1, release=0). Key repeat events (value=2) are never filtered. Non-key events (e.g., mouse movements, synchronization events) are passed through unmodified.
// .PP
// It is designed for the Linux environment using the \fBevdev\fR input system and integrates seamlessly with the Interception Tools ecosystem, typically placed in a pipeline between \fBintercept\fR(1) (to capture events) and \fBuinput\fR(1) (to create a filtered virtual device).
// .PP
// Performance is critical for input filtering. \fB{bin_name}\fR uses a mutex to protect the core filter state and a separate thread for logging and statistics to minimize latency impact on the main event processing path. See the PERFORMANCE section for more details.
// "#;

const MAN_DEBOUNCING: &str = r#"
.B Mechanism
.PP
\fB{bin_name}\fR works by remembering the timestamp of the last \fIpassed\fR event for each unique combination of key code (e.g., KEY_A) and key state (press=1, release=0).
When a new key event arrives, it checks if it's identical to the last passed event for that key/state combination.
If it is identical and the time difference since the last passed event is \fIless than\fR the configured \fB\-\-debounce\-time\fR, the new event is considered a bounce and is dropped (not written to standard output).
If the time difference is greater than or equal to the debounce time, or if the event is different (different key code or different state), the event is passed through and its timestamp is recorded as the new "last passed" time for that specific key/state.
.PP
Key repeat events (value=2) are always passed through without debouncing, as they represent intentional key holds.
.PP
.B Choosing \-\-debounce\-time
.IP \(bu 4
Start with the default (\fB25ms\fR) or a common value like \fB15ms\fR.
.IP \(bu 4
If you experience missed keystrokes, the debounce time might be too high. Try lowering it (e.g., to 10ms or 5ms).
.IP \(bu 4
If you still experience duplicate characters (chatter), the debounce time might be too low.
.IP \(bu 4
To diagnose chatter on specific keys, run with \fB\-\-log\-bounces\fR and a low debounce time (e.g., \fB\-\-debounce\-time 5ms\fR). Observe the logs to see which keys are frequently dropped and the typical time difference reported for the bounces. Increase the debounce time to be slightly higher than the observed bounce times for problematic keys.
.IP \(bu 4
Typical values range from 5ms to 30ms. Mechanical switches might require slightly higher values than membrane switches.
.IP \(bu 4
Setting \fB\-\-debounce\-time 0ms\fR effectively disables filtering, passing all events through. This is useful with \fB\-\-log\-all\-events\fR to observe raw event timings.
"#;

const MAN_NEAR_MISS: &str = r#"
.B Purpose
.PP
The near-miss feature is a diagnostic tool to identify key presses or releases that occur just slightly \fIafter\fR the debounce window closes. It helps understand key timing consistency and identify keys that might be close to chattering.
.PP
.B Mechanism
.PP
When a key event \fIpasses\fR the debounce filter (i.e., it's not a bounce), \fB{bin_name}\fR calculates the time difference since the \fIprevious passed event\fR for the same key code and state. If this difference is less than or equal to the \fB\-\-near\-miss\-threshold\-time\fR (and greater than or equal to the \fB\-\-debounce\-time\fR, which is implicit for passed events), it's recorded as a near-miss.
.PP
.B Interpretation
.IP \(bu 4
High near-miss counts for a specific key suggest its timing is inconsistent or very close to the debounce threshold.
.IP \(bu 4
This might indicate a switch that is starting to fail or that the \fB\-\-debounce\-time\fR might need a slight increase for that particular keyboard.
.IP \(bu 4
Near-miss statistics are primarily useful for fine-tuning the debounce time or identifying potentially problematic hardware switches.
.PP
.B Configuration
.IP \(bu 4
The \fB\-\-near\-miss\-threshold\-time\fR should generally be set significantly higher than the \fB\-\-debounce\-time\fR (e.g., 100ms threshold vs 20ms debounce) to capture relevant events without being overly noisy.
.IP \(bu 4
Setting the threshold to the same value as the debounce time (or 0ms) effectively disables near-miss tracking.

sudo sh \-c 'intercept \-g /dev/input/by\-id/your\-kbd | {bin_name} \-\-debounce\-time 15ms | uinput \-d /dev/input/by\-id/your\-kbd'
.fi
.PP
Intercept events from your keyboard (replace placeholder path), filter them with a 15ms debounce window, and create a new virtual keyboard device with the filtered output. Applications should use the new virtual device created by \fBuinput\fR.
.PP
.B Filtering with Bounce Logging:
.IP
.nf
sudo sh \-c 'intercept \-g ... | {bin_name} \-\-debounce\-time 20ms \-\-log\-bounces | uinput \-d ...'
.fi
.PP
Filter with a 20ms threshold and log only the key events that are dropped (considered bounces) to standard error. Useful for identifying which keys are chattering without logging every event.
.PP
.B Diagnosing Chatter Timing:
.IP
.nf
sudo sh \-c 'intercept \-g ... | {bin_name} \-\-debounce\-time 5ms \-\-log\-bounces | uinput \-d ...'

Run with a low debounce time (5ms) and log bounces. Observe the reported time differences for dropped events to determine an appropriate debounce time for your keyboard (set it slightly higher than the observed bounce times).
.PP
.B Periodic Stats Dump (every 5 minutes):
.IP
.nf
sudo sh \-c 'intercept \-g ... | {bin_name} \-\-log\-interval 5m | uinput \-d ...'
.fi
.PP
Run with default filtering and print detailed statistics to standard error every 5 minutes, in addition to the final report on exit.
.PP
.B JSON Statistics Output:

const MAN_INTEGRATION: &str = r#"
\fB{bin_name}\fR is designed to work with Interception Tools. It can be used in pipelines or within a \fBudevmon\fR(1) configuration file (\fIudevmon.yaml\fR).
.PP
.B Pipeline Usage
.PP
The standard usage involves a pipeline: \fBintercept\fR -> \fB{bin_name}\fR -> \fBuinput\fR.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBintercept \-g <device>\fR: Captures raw input events from the specified hardware device.
.IP \(bu 4
\fB{bin_name} [OPTIONS]\fR: Reads events from stdin, filters them, and writes filtered events to stdout.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBuinput \-d <device>\fR: Reads filtered events from stdin and creates a new virtual input device mirroring the original device's capabilities but emitting only the filtered events.
.PP
.B Virtual Device
.PP
It is crucial to understand that \fBuinput\fR creates a \fInew\fR virtual input device (e.g., /dev/input/eventX). Your applications and desktop environment (Xorg/Wayland) must be configured to use \fIthis new virtual device\fR instead of the original physical keyboard device. The original device will still emit raw, unfiltered events. How to configure the desktop environment varies; sometimes it picks up the new device automatically, other times specific Xorg configuration (e.g., `InputDevice` section with `Option "GrabDevice" "True"`) or Wayland compositor settings might be needed. Check your desktop environment's documentation. You can often identify the virtual device by looking for "Uinput" in its name via tools like \fBlibinput list-devices\fR or checking devices created after the pipeline starts.
.PP
.B udevmon Integration
.PP
Using \fBudevmon\fR is often the most robust way to manage the pipeline, automatically starting and stopping it when the keyboard is connected or disconnected.
.IP
.nf
# Example /etc/udevmon.yaml entry
\- JOB: "intercept \-g $DEVNODE | {bin_name} \-\-debounce\-time 15ms | uinput \-d $DEVNODE"
  DEVICE:
    LINK: "/dev/input/by\-id/usb\-Your_Keyboard_Name\-event\-kbd"
.fi
.PP
Replace the \fILINK\fR value with the appropriate path for your keyboard found in \fI/dev/input/by-id/\fR. The \fI$DEVNODE\fR variable is automatically substituted by \fBudevmon\fR with the actual device path (e.g., /dev/input/event5). Refer to the Interception Tools documentation for more details on configuring \fBudevmon\fR.
.PP
.B Wayland/Xorg Considerations
.PP
Interception Tools, especially global input capture, generally work most reliably under Xorg. Wayland compositors often restrict global input grabbing for security reasons. Using \fB{bin_name}\fR under Wayland might require specific compositor support (e.g., `libei` integration in the compositor) or might only work for applications that directly use the virtual device created by `uinput`. Check your Wayland compositor's documentation regarding input device management and potential compatibility with virtual input devices.

\fB{bin_name}\fR is designed for low-latency input filtering.
.PP
.B Architecture:
.IP \(bu 4
\fBMain Thread\fR: Reads events from stdin, acquires a mutex lock on the filter state, performs the debounce check (array lookup and comparison), updates state if necessary, releases the lock, sends event info to the logger thread via a channel, and writes passed events to stdout.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBLogger Thread\fR: Receives event info from the channel, updates statistics (lock-free atomics for simple counts, Vecs for timings), handles periodic stats dumps, and performs logging to stderr.
.PP
.B Latency Considerations:
.IP \(bu 4
The primary latency contributor on the main path is the mutex lock for the filter state (`BounceFilter::last_event_us`). This lock is held briefly during the check.
.IP \(bu 4
Sending data to the logger thread uses a bounded channel (`crossbeam-channel`). If the logger thread falls behind (e.g., due to slow disk I/O for logging or high CPU load), the channel might fill up. To prevent blocking the main input path, the main thread uses `try_send`. If the channel is full, a warning is logged ("Logger channel full, dropping log messages"), and the event info is \fIdropped\fR (not sent to the logger). This prioritizes low input latency over potentially losing some log messages or stats updates under heavy load.
.IP \(bu 4
Heavy logging (especially `--log-all-events` or TRACE level) significantly increases the work done by the logger thread and the likelihood of the channel filling up. It also increases overall CPU usage.

.TP
.B Permission Denied (reading /dev/input/event* or writing /dev/uinput):
Running \fBintercept\fR and \fBuinput\fR typically requires root privileges or specific user group memberships. Ensure the user running the pipeline has read access to the target input device (\fI/dev/input/event*\fR) and write access to \fI/dev/uinput\fR. Adding the user to the 'input' group often grants read access, but write access to `/dev/uinput` might require specific udev rules (see Interception Tools documentation). Running the entire pipeline via `sudo sh -c '...'` is a common workaround.
.TP
.B Incorrect Device Path:
Double-check the device path used with \fBintercept \-g\fR or in \fIudevmon.yaml\fR. Use stable paths from \fI/dev/input/by-id/\fR or \fI/dev/input/by-path/\fR instead of potentially unstable \fI/dev/input/eventX\fR paths. Use \fBintercept \-L\fR to list devices.

Updates statistics stored in a `StatsCollector` struct. Simple counts use lock-free atomics (`std::sync::atomic`), while timing vectors (`Vec<u64>`) are updated directly as the `StatsCollector` is owned solely by the logger thread.
.IP \(bu 4
Performs logging to standard error based on the configured logging flags (`--log-all-events`, `--log-bounces`) and log level (`RUST_LOG`, `--verbose`). Logging uses the `tracing` framework.
.RE
.IP 4. 4
Periodically checks if the configured `--log-interval` has elapsed. If so, prints the current interval statistics and resets them.
.IP 5. 4
Continues until the main thread signals shutdown (by dropping the channel sender or setting an atomic flag).
.IP 6. 4
On shutdown, returns the final `StatsCollector` containing cumulative statistics to the main thread.
.PP
.B State Management:
.IP \(bu 4
The core filter state (`last_event_us` array) is protected by a `Mutex` to ensure safe access from the main thread (which modifies it) and potentially other threads if the design were different (though currently only the main thread accesses it mutably).
.IP \(bu 4
Statistics are managed primarily by the logger thread, minimizing contention on the main path.
.IP \(bu 4
Inter-thread communication uses `crossbeam-channel`, chosen for its performance characteristics.
