# Example udevmon configuration for intercept-bounce

# Job 1: Basic filtering (default 10ms window)
# - JOB: "intercept -g $DEVNODE | intercept-bounce | uinput -d $DEVNODE"
#   DEVICE:
#     LINK: "/dev/input/by-id/usb-Your_Keyboard_Name-event-kbd"

# Job 2: Filtering with verbose logging and periodic stats dump every 1000 key events
# Statistics and logs will go to the systemd service journal for this job.
- JOB: "intercept -g $DEVNODE | intercept-bounce --verbose --log-interval 1000 | uinput -d $DEVNODE"
  DEVICE:
    # Match your specific keyboard device.
    # You can find the correct LINK using `udevadm info -q path -n /dev/input/eventXX`
    # or by looking in /dev/input/by-id/
    LINK: "/dev/input/by-id/usb-Logitech_G915_WIRELESS_RGB_MECHANICAL_GAMING_KEYBOARD_*-event-kbd"
    # Optionally, you can also match by events the device supports
    # EVENTS:
    #   EV_KEY: [[KEY_CAPSLOCK]] # Example: match devices with CAPSLOCK
