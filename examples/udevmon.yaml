# Example udevmon configuration for intercept-bounce
#
# Remember to replace the LINK pattern with one matching your specific keyboard.
# Find links in /dev/input/by-id/ or use `udevadm info` on your /dev/input/eventX device.

# --- Example 1: Basic Filtering ---
# Apply default 10ms debouncing to a specific keyboard.
- JOB: "intercept -g $DEVNODE | intercept-bounce | uinput -d $DEVNODE"
  DEVICE:
    LINK: "/dev/input/by-id/usb-Your_Keyboard_Name-event-kbd" # Replace this!

# --- Example 2: Filtering with Periodic Stats ---
# Apply 15ms debouncing and log full statistics every 5 minutes (300 seconds).
# Statistics and any other stderr output will go to the systemd service journal for this job.
- JOB: "intercept -g $DEVNODE | intercept-bounce --debounce-time 15 --log-interval 300 | uinput -d $DEVNODE"
  DEVICE:
    LINK: "/dev/input/by-id/usb-Logitech_G915_WIRELESS_RGB_MECHANICAL_GAMING_KEYBOARD_*-event-kbd" # Replace/adjust this!

# --- Example 3: Logging Only Bounced Events ---
# Apply 20ms debouncing and log only the details of events that were actually dropped.
# Useful for diagnosing chatter without logging every single event.
- JOB: "intercept -g $DEVNODE | intercept-bounce --debounce-time 20 --log-bounces | uinput -d $DEVNODE"
  DEVICE:
    LINK: "/dev/input/by-id/usb-Another_Keyboard_*-event-kbd" # Replace this!
